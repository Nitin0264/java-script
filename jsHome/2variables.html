    // js is a syncronous single threaded language

//  in js we can only store data in variables
// there are three ways to  declar a variable

// 1 - let        let has a fixed value but can be changed later
// 2 - const      const has a fixed value and cant be changed later
// 3 - var        var is globally scoped and can be changed later


    // variable is a container to store data 
    // we can use var , let , const to declare a variable 
    // var is globally scoped 
    // let is block scoped 
    // const is block scoped and value cant be changed 
  
    let variable1 = 3;
    console.log(variable1);
    // this will display the above value in the console


    let calculation = 2 + 2;
    console.log(calculation);

    console.log(calculation + 2);
    // this will add 2 to previous calculation value and display 6


    let result = calculation + 2;
    console.log(result)
    // this will store the new value into the rsult it is perforrming the same operation as above

   let message = 'hello';
   console.log(message);
  //  this is the way to store the string in a variable
