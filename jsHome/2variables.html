    // js is a syncronous single threaded language

//  in js we can only store data in variables
// there are three ways to  declar a variable

// 1 - let        let has a fixed value but can be changed later
// 2 - const      const has a fixed value and cant be changed later
// 3 - var        var is globally scoped and can be changed later




// when we create a variable first we use the keywork let , const or var  then name the variabele and ater it at last we assign a value to a variable using the  equal operator or sign

// eg
let n = 10;
// keywored name  equal sign value 10 is value

    // variable is a container to store data 
    // we can use var , let , const to declare a variable 
    // var is globally scoped 
    // let is block scoped 
    // const is block scoped and value cant be changed 
  
    let variable1 = 3;
    console.log(variable1);
    // this is called as assigning a value to a variable
    // this will display the above value in the console


    let calculation = 2 + 2;
    console.log(calculation);

    console.log(calculation + 2);
    // this will add 2 to previous calculation value and display 6


    let result = calculation + 2;
    console.log(result)
    // this will store the new value into the rsult it is perforrming the same operation as above

   let message = 'hello';
   console.log(message);
  //  this is the way to store the string in a variable 






  // day 2 after update 

  // js has a special feature semi colen insertion

  // next we are going to learn how to change the  value saved in a variable

variable1 = 5;   
console.log(variable1);

// and this is called re assigning the value to a variable


// reassigning variable 1 
variable1 = variable1 + 1;
console.log(variable1);
// this will take the previous value of variable1 add 1 to it and reassign the new value to variable1



// we are going to learn the type of variabels in js 

console.log(typeof variable1);
console.log(typeof message);
// this will display the type of variable stored in variable1 and message
